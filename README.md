### Problem we're solving
Sometimes I wish I had a magic 8 ball but don't.

### Solution
Make an app that is a magic 8 ball.

### What it looks like
- A black circle with white text in it

## Execution

### The Interface
1) We need the 8 ball itself
2) We need the text that's displayed inside the 8 ball
3) We need to be able to [tap the 8 ball like a button](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/touchableopacity.html).


### The Data
1) Make an `array` full of quotes that the 8 ball will cycle through.
2) We need a way to note which quote is active
3) We need a way to change which quote is active to another random quote when the button is pressed

### Extra Credit
1) How can we randomize the quote when the phone is shaken?
2) How can we animate the ball when the quote is changed?
3) How can we draw other shapes?
